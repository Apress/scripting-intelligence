Dear Reader,

That you for purchasing my book. This directory contains the source code
and data for the examples in my book. As an alternative to installing
all of the tools and libraries that I use in the examples, you can use the
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that I have created (see Appendix A for details).
The AMI has MySLQ, PostgreSQL, Tomcat, Sesame, Nutch, Solr, D2R, Redland,
AllegroGraph, etc. installed and configured.

There are subdirectories for each part of my book. I did not separate the examples
into directories for individual chapters because sometimes examples for different
chapters in a book part share libraries and data.

Each subdirectory also contains a README.txt file. Many of the examples require
other software (usually open source) to run - these dependencies, with download
links, are listed in the book. The README.txt files in the book part subdirectories
contain information for running the examples in the same order as the material
appears in the book.

I appreciate hearing from readers of my books if they have specific
problems running any of the example programs. I try to resolve their issues
and place new HOW-TO information on the errata page for my books.  The most
current information for this book will be kept at: http://markwatson.com/books/web3_book/
This link also will point you to information and resources on the APress
web site.

Best regards,
Mark Watson
